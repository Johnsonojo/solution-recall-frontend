# solution-recall-frontend

Solution recall is a platform that allows software developers and anyone learning to code to save problems or blocker encountered and their solutions, and then recall then at a later time when they need to.

Imagine you are a software developer or learning how to code and you encounter a problem which you eventually solved. All you need to do is save the problem with its solution so that you can recall it sometimes in the future when you encounter the same problem. Just recall the solution by searching using a keyword.
